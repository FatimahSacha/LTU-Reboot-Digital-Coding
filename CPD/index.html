    <h4>Introduction to Web Development</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Today I learnt about the different positions in web development, like what a front end developer is and does and how they play a huge role in the technology industry. I learnt that front end web development consists of three technologies.These include HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>
    <p>I also learnt how to create my own repository and how to push it onto my github desktop. </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>I will use this in prcatice by uploading this document and forking it onto my github desktop. Also with the programming languages I will be learning alongside the projects. I will be completing the Freecodecamp certificates and completing the challenges on the mimo and SoloLearn app to further aid my learning.</p>

    <h4>Learning HTML</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Today I leart about the structure of HTML and the four main tags that make up the HTML structure. These are !doctype html, head, title and body all enclosed in left-angled bracket and a right angled bracket.<br>
    I also learnt that a HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. Attributes can also be found in elements and this gives more information to the browser about that element. An example of this is the anchor tag which uses a href attribute. This attribute indicates the links destination. </p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>To put what I've learnt into practice I have started to create my own clone of the Google home page. To make myself more comfortable with using this type of code i have started to use Frecodecamp and the mimo app to ensure I have understood what I have been taught. </p>

    <h4>Introduction to CSS</h4>
    <h5>What have I learnt?</h5>
    <p>Today I learnt that CSS is the language that is used to style how the elements in html will be displayed and how it can control multiple web pages all at once. The CSS syntax consists of a selecore and a declaration block. An example of this is h1 { color:red;}. Within CSS you can have multiple declarations for one selector. </p>
    <p> When creating and designing a web page the design and layout is important. In CSS the box model is used to represent this. The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.</p>
    <h5>How did I use this in practice?</h5>
    <p>In the Google clone page I started to style the header. I changed the colour to grey and the font size to 18px.</p>
    <p>To get a better understanding of CSS I used Freecodecamp and W3 Schools to understand how CSS controls the styling of the HTML elements.
